## Extension options
By default tracklist is shown. You can change it in option panel.

## Limitations:
- Mixcloud returns tracklist's datas only if you're logged. Could happened that Mixcloud don't returns tracklist at all for few minutes. In that case, wait a little, and reload the page.
- Don't work on mobile website. Have to work on it.

## Thanks
 - [Jean-Christophe Henry](http://www.oddsquid.com/) for icon's design.
 - [Andrew Lawson](https://github.com/adlawson) for his previous Mixcloud Tracklist Extension (didn't fork it because Extension is full rewrited)
